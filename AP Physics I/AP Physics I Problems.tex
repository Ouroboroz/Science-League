A major issue in the news is the Trump border wall. Suppose that such a wall were to be build and the wall is $11m$ tall. Kevin is a very curious kid and wants to see at what angle would it take to launch a ball over the wall. Sadly, Kevin isn't very bright and built a cemented down launcher located at $14m$ away from the wall. Furthermore, the launcher can only shoot at an angle of $56$ degrees. What is the minimum speed so the ball can just pass over the top of the wall.
